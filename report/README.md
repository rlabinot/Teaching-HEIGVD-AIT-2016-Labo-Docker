##Task 0: Identify issues and install the tools

1. [M1] Do you think we can use the current solution for a production environment? What are the main problems when deploying it in a production environment?



2. [M2] Describe what you need to do to add new webapp container to the infrastructure. Give the exact steps of what you have to do without modifiying the way the things are done. Hint: You probably have to modify some configuration and script files in a Docker image.



3. [M3] Based on your previous answers, you have detected some issues in the current solution. Now propose a better approach at a high level.



4. [M4] You probably noticed that the list of web application nodes is hardcoded in the load balancer configuration. How can we manage the web app nodes in a more dynamic fashion?

5. [M5] In the physical or virtual machines of a typical infrastructure we tend to have not only one main process (like the web server or the load balancer) running, but a few additional processes on the side to perform management tasks.

   For example to monitor the distributed system as a whole it is common to collect in one centralized place all the logs produced by the different machines. Therefore we need a process running on each machine that will forward the logs to the central place. (We could also imagine a central tool that reaches out to each machine to gather the logs. That's a push vs. pull problem.) It is quite common to see a push mechanism used for this kind of task.

   Do you think our current solution is able to run additional management processes beside the main web server / load balancer process in a container? If no, what is missing / required to reach the goal? If yes, how to proceed to run for example a log forwarding process?



6. [M6] In our current solution, although the load balancer configuration is changing dynamically, it doesn't follow dynamically the configuration of our distributed system when web servers are added or removed. If we take a closer look at the run.sh script, we see two calls to sed which will replace two lines in the haproxy.cfg configuration file just before we start haproxy. You clearly see that the configuration file has two lines and the script will replace these two lines.

What happens if we add more web server nodes? Do you think it is really dynamic? It's far away from being a dynamic configuration. Can you propose a solution to solve this?

####Deliverables:

1. Take a screenshot of the stats page of HAProxy at  [http://192.168.42.42:1936](http://192.168.42.42:1936/). You should see your backend nodes.

2. Give the URL of your repository URL in the lab report.  <https://github.com/rlabinot/Teaching-HEIGVD-AIT-2016-Labo-Docker>

### Task 1: Add a process supervisor to run several process

####Deliverables:

1. Take a screenshot of the stats page of HAProxy at [http://192.168.42.42:1936](http://192.168.42.42:1936/). You should see your backend nodes. It should be really similar to the screenshot of the previous task.

2. Describe your difficulties for this task and your understanding of what is happening during this task. Explain in your own words why are we installing a process supervisor. Do not hesitate to do more research and to find more articles on that topic to illustrate the problem.

### Task 2: Add a tool to manage membership in the web server cluster

####Deliverables:

1. Provide the docker log output for each of the containers: ha, s1 and s2. You need to create a folder logs in your repository to store the files separately from the lab report. For each lab task create a folder and name it using the task number. No need to create a folder when there are no logs.

Example:

|-- root folder
  |-- logs
​    |-- task 1
​    |-- task 3
​    |-- ...



2. Give the answer to the question about the existing problem with the current solution.

3. Give an explanation on how Serf is working. Read the official website to get more details about the GOSSIP protocol used in Serf. Try to find other solutions that can be used to solve similar situations where we need some auto-discovery mechanism.

### Task 3: React to membership changes

####Deliverables:

1. Provide the docker log output for each of the containers: ha, s1 and s2. Put your logs in the logs directory you created in the previous task.

2. Provide the logs from the ha container gathered directly from the /var/log/serf.log file present in the container. Put the logs in the logs directory in your repo.

### Task 4: Use a template engine to easily generate configuration files

####Deliverables:

1. You probably noticed when we added xz-utils, we have to rebuild the whole image which took some time. What can we do to mitigate that? Take a look at the Docker documentation on [image layers](https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/storagedriver/imagesandcontainers/#images-and-layers). Tell us about the pros and cons to merge as much as possible of the command. In other words, compare:

   RUN command 1
   RUN command 2
   RUN command 3
   vs.
   RUN command 1 && command 2 && command 3



There are also some articles about techniques to reduce the image size. Try to find them. They are talking about squashing or flattening images.

2. Propose a different approach to architecture our images to be able to reuse as much as possible what we have done. Your proposition should also try to avoid as much as possible repetitions between your images.

3. Provide the /tmp/haproxy.cfg file generated in the ha container after each step. Place the output into the logs folder like you already did for the Docker logs in the previous tasks. Three files are expected.

In addition, provide a log file containing the output of the docker ps console and another file (per container) with docker inspect <container>. Four files are expected.

4. Based on the three output files you have collected, what can you say about the way we generate it? What is the problem if any?

### Task 5: Generate a new load balancer configuration when membership changes

####Deliverables:

1. Provide the file /usr/local/etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg generated in the ha container after each step. Three files are expected.

   In addition, provide a log file containing the output of the docker ps console and another file (per container) with docker inspect <container>. Four files are expected.

2. Provide the list of files from the /nodes folder inside the ha container. One file expected with the command output.

3. Provide the configuration file after you stopped one container and the list of nodes present in the /nodes folder. One file expected with the command output. Two files are expected.

   In addition, provide a log file containing the output of the docker ps console. One file expected.

4. (Optional:) Propose a different approach to manage the list of backend nodes. You do not need to implement it. You can also propose your own tools or the ones you discovered online. In that case, do not forget to cite your references.

### Task 6: Make the load balancer automatically reload the new configuration

####Deliverables:

1. Take a screenshots of the HAProxy stat page showing more than 2 web applications running. Additional screenshots are welcome to see a sequence of experimentations like shutting down a node and starting more nodes.

2. Also provide the output of docker ps in a log file. At least one file is expected. You can provide one output per step of your experimentation according to your screenshots.

3. Give your own feelings about the final solution. Propose improvements or ways to do the things differently. If any, provide references to your readings for the improvements.

4. (Optional:) Present a live demo where you add and remove a backend container.
